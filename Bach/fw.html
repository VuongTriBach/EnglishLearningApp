        Bulda2      : Shush! I'm trying to listen. Cuties. I'm going to keep you. 
        Bulda       : Your Majesty. Born with the powers, or cursed?
        King        : ohhh, Born. And they're getting stronger. 
        Bulda       : Here, here. You are lucky It wasn't her heart. The heart is not so easily changed. But the head can be persuaded. 
        King        : Do what you must. 
        Bulda       : I recommend we remove all magic. Even memories of magic, to be safe. But don't worry. I'll leave the fun. She will be okay.
        Elsa        : But she won't remember I have powers?
        King        : It's for the best. 
        Bulda       : Listen to me, Elsa. Your power will only grow. There is beauty in it... But also great danger. You must learn to control it. Fear will be your enemy. 
        King        : No! We'll protect her. She can learn to control it. I'm sure. Till then... We'll lock the gates. We reduce the staff. We will limit the contact with people, keep her powers hidden from eveyone.

        Flynn Rider : Is that hair?
        Rapunzel    : Struggling...struggling is pointless. I know you're here and I'm not afraid of you.
        Flynn Rider : What?
        Rapunzel    : Who are you and how did you find me? Who are you and how did you find me?
        Flynn Rider : I know not who you are, nor how I came to find you but may I just say "Hi, how you doing? My name's Flynn Rider. How's your day going ,huh?"
        Rapunzel    : Who else knows my location, Flynn Rider?
        Flynn Rider : Alright, blondie -( Rapunzel). Give and take. Here's the deal. I was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest. I came across your tower. And... Ho, oh no. Where is my satchel.
        Rapunzel    : I hid it somewhere you never find it.
        Flynn Rider : It's in that pot, isn't it? Will you stop that? 
        Rapunzel    : Now, it is hidden where you'll never find it. So...what you want with my hair? To cut it? 
        Flynn Rider : What?
        Rapunzel    : Sell it?
        Flynn Rider : Nooooo. Listen. The only thing I want to do with your hair is get out of it. Literally!
        Rapunzel    : Wait. You don't want my hair? 
        Flynn Rider : Why on earth what I want your hair? Look, I was being chased, I saw a tower, and I climbed it, end the story.
        Rapunzel    : You...you're telling the truth?
        Flynn Rider : Yess!
